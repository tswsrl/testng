#Angular Two Way Binding Sample on Silex

This sample is written to demonstrate the power of [AngularJS](https://code.angularjs.org/1.5.0/docs/api) and to try out [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/)

##Installation instructions

First clone this repository, then execute the following commands on a CLI.

```bash
php composer.phar install
php -S localhost:8888 -t web web/index.php
```

Obviously if you have a global Composer you can use that; if you have another web server you can use that.
